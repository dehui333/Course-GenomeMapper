# Preliminaries

Participants should first create a [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) account. As usage of password on CLI is deprecated, they will also need to create an SSH key and add it to their account following steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent), [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) and [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection). Once completed, fork this repository and clone it with:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<username>/Course-GenomeMapper
```

In addition, participants need to get through the following tutorials:
  - [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
  - [GitHub](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
  - [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html)
  - [Googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/primer.md)
  - [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions)
